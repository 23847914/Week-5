    <p> Learning how to code has been quite the experience for me so far. Initially, I struggled to get the hang of how to solve many issues, but the more I have worked on the code, the more easier it has become to find the appropiate solution. I feel if you're beginning code for the first time, there's plenty to take in, but with time, you grow accustomed to carrying out the necessary techniques needed to code. For example, when I started my web assignment, I would occasionally forget to document my commits but the more I got used to HTML and VSC, the more often I'd make sure to commit my changes. Going back to lecture notes definitely helped me when I was struggling. It allowed me to refresh my mind with the techniques I needed to use and the right way I needed to code particular information. I chose to go for text-shadow personally because I like the design it comes out with, it feels it adds a pop to the text. I also decided to make the border black as it makes the page look cleaner and more organised on the eye. </p>

    <p>Important tips:
     When you're stuck on a piece of code, take a step back and allow yourself to have a break to refresh your mind. I found this helped me to clear my mind from any frustrations I had if the code I wanted to present wasn't linear to what I saw on the screen.
        Ensure to reach out to your lecturer or look back at lecture notes if you're feeling stuck and can't resolve it.
